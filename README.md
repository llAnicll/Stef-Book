**Firebase / Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** 
(One project is used for both. This was done with firebase as the fucus)

## Overview

### Purpose
Allow users the ability to join upcoming clinics/events, and allow admin(s) to add/remove them.  

### What did I use?
- Firebase auth
- Firestore
- React.js
- Material UI

---

## Why am I using React for something like this?
Yes, this project could have easly been done using vanilla JavaScript, I know. I was looking to work with react, as well as MUI's styled components, because MUI's components provided me with great variation in component to use, it also allowed great and easy flexibility within the design and its components. As 
someone who's forte isn't UI/UX design, MUI made this a simpler in terms of design and allowed for changes to be made where needed.
